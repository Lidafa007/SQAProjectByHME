# SQA in software process

In this chapter 4, We are mainly learning about quality assurance in context, which include defect handling, QA in software processes and v&v perspective. Then we talk about the difference between defect view and verification&validation view. Defect handling includes recording of status and tracking, causal (root-cause) analysis, defect removal, breaking the causal chain. Then we learn how to measure and analysis defect.

The traditional software process (waterfall development process) include requirement, specification, design, coding, testing, release. QA is exist in all phase of the software process. In the phase of requirements analysis, design and coding, QA focus on defect prevention. In the phase of testing, QA focus on defect removal. And in the phase of release and support, QA focus on defect containment. There are some other software processes, such as iterative development process, spiral development process, agile development processes and XP (extreme programming) etc. QA is important in all processes. A quality product is one which meets its requirements and satisfies the user. SQC activities include mentoring how to produce artifacts, such as well-defined engineering documents using standard templates, mentoring how to conduct standard processes, such as quality reviews, Perform in-process quality reviews to verify, evaluate and confirm artifacts, verify and evaluate to improve the use of methods, procedures and adopted software tools.

# SQE Activities

In chapter 5, we have learn about software quality engineering, key activities in SQE and how SQE play in Software Process. In the software process, firstly SQE  need to do quality planning to set quality goals, and then select the measurements&models to do some quality assessments and improvement, finally to analysis if the quality goals is satisfied. SQE activities are part of development activities. Because quality planning is part of product planning, QA activities are part of development activities, analysis/feedback is part of project management. 

# About Testing

There are many approaches to software testing. Reviews, walkthroughs, or inspections are referred to as static testing, whereas actually executing programmed code with a given set of test cases is referred to as dynamic testing. Static testing involves verification, whereas dynamic testing involves validation. Together they help improve software quality. Among the techniques for static analysis, mutation testing can be used to ensure the test-cases will detect errors which are introduced by mutating the source code.

## white-box testing

Software testing methods are traditionally divided into white- and black-box testing. These two approaches are used to describe the point of view that a test engineer takes when designing test cases. White-box testing(also known as structural testing) tests internal structures or workings of a program, as opposed to the functionality exposed to the end-user. In white-box testing an internal perspective of the system, as well as programming skills, are used to design test cases. Techniques used in white-box testing include: API testing, code coverage, fault injection methods, mutation testing methods etc. Code coverage tools can evaluate the completeness of a test suite that was created with any method, including black-box testing.

## Black-box testing

Black-box testing treats the software as a "black box", examining functionality without any knowledge of internal implementation. The tester is only aware of what the software is supposed to do, not how it does it. Black-box testing methods include: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all-pairs testing, state transition tables, decision table testing, fuzz testing, use case testing and so on.
