## Chapter 4

In this chapter, We are mainly learning about quality assurance in context, which include defect handling, QA in software processes and v&v perspective. Then we talk about the difference between defect view and verification&validation view. Defect handling includes recording of status and tracking, causal (root-cause) analysis, defect removal, breaking the causal chain. Then we learn how to measure and analysis defect.

The traditional software process (waterfall development process) include requirement, specification, design, coding, testing, release. QA is exist in all phase of the software process. In the phase of requirements analysis, design and coding, QA focus on defect prevention. In the phase of testing, QA focus on defect removal. And in the phase of release and support, QA focus on defect containment. There are some other software processes, such as iterative development process, spiral development process, agile development processes and XP (extreme programming) etc. QA is important in all processes.
