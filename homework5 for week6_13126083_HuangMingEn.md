## Pairwise comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives ##

### Tesing VS Defect prevention ###

- Different applicability to maintenance
- Objects QA activities applied on
	- testing executable code
	- defect prevention on(implementation related) dev. activities
- Different development phases
	- tesing on testing phase and later
	- defect prevention on (req/spec/design/coding)
- General expertise levels
	- tesing-low
	- defect prevention-medium
- Problem or defect types
	- tesing : dynamic failures & related faults
	- defect prevention: negating causes or pre-conditions to pervasive problems
- Ease of result interpretation: Moderate/intangible
- Cost: tesing is medium /defect prevention is low

### Tesing VS Formal verification ###

- tesing is important link in dev. process
- defect situations
	- tesing : Medium/low 
	- formal verification : Low/no
- Cost: tesing-moderate / formal verification-high
- Different development phases

### Tesing VS Fault tolerance ###

- Problem or defect types
	- Tesing : Dynamic/run-time/interaction problems
	- Fault tolerance : Dynamic problems (must be rare)
- moderate cost / High cost & reliability (low defect)
- General expertise levels
	- tesing : low - high
	- Fault tolerance : high , need specific background knowledge- Dynamic system
- applied on specific objects
	- testing : executable code
	- Fault tolerance : operational software system

### Tesing VS Failure containment ###

- moderate cost / Extremely high cost
	- Failure containment applys only when safety matters
- Process/technology intensive
- Effectiveness
	- tesing for failures
	- Failure containment : rare accidents
- Ease of result interpretation
	- Tesing : moderate
	- Failure containment: hard
- expertise levels : Tesing is low / Failure containment is high
	- Failure containment need specific background knowledge——safety,embedded systems
